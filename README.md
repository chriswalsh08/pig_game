# PIG! A Simple Dice Game

This game was created during the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy, taught by Jonas Schedtmann.

## Rules
- The game has two players playing in rounds.
- In each round, a player rolls two dice as often as they want. The result is added to their ROUND score.
- At any time in their turn, the player can HOLD and roll their ROUND score into their GLOBAL score.
- If the player rolls a 1 on either dice, their round ends, they lose their ROUND score, and the turn is passed to the next player.
- If the player rolls a 6 on both dice, their round ends, they lose their GLOBAL score, and the turn is passed to the next player.
- First to reach the target amount wins!

## Importance of Files
- **css** folder: holds stylesheet containing CSS for the Pig game UI
- **img** folder: holds .png files for dice faces and background image
- **app.js**: contains the JavaScript used for manipulating DOM objects, initializing the game, and updating UI
- **index.html**: HTML elements for structuring the web page

## Have fun!
